Circuit implemented:
 - Fig. 1a
 
Data contained:
 - Vin vs Firing/single_neuron_vin_osc.mat: simulations data with spiking induced by the VIN with millivolts variations
 - Vin vs Firing/vin_osc_measures.mat: measurementes of the spiking induced by the VIN with millivolts variations
 - Vin vs Firing/single_neuron_vin_osc.mat: simulations data with spiking induced by the VIN with microvolts variations

Reproduce the simulations:
To reproduce the simulations, the circuit in Fig. 1a with the parameters reported in the Methods section of the paper should be implemented and a transient simulation should be executed. By adding a 20 mVpp oscillation at the input voltage and by setting the DC voltage input to a proper level, it's possible to obtain the behaviour in Fig. 5a. Same can be updated for Fig. 5f when the oscillation is at the amplitude stated in the paper.

Running the code:
 - To plot Fig.5 panels a, run the code "Vin vs Firing/single_neuron_vin_osc.m" in MATLAB
 - To plot Fig.5 panels f, run the code "Vin vs Firing with microvolts/single_neuron_vin_osc.m" in MATLAB
