Circuit implemented:
 - Fig. 1a
 - Fig. 2b
 
Data contained:
 - S curves/Scurve_data_IV.mat: Data for the S curve measured in the I(V) case
 - S curves/Scurve_data_VI.mat: Data for the S curve measured in the V(I) case
 - Transient simulations/data_oscillation.mat: Data for the transient simulations

Reproduce the simulations:
To reproduce the S curves in Fig. 1 panels b and c, the circuit in Fig. 2b with the parameters reported in the Methods section of the paper should be implemented and a DC simulation should be executed. The MATLAB code requires the voltage and current at the output nodes of the circuits (i.e., Vout and Iout).
To reproduce the transient simulations in Fig. 1 panels d and e, the circuit in Fig. 1a with the parameters reported in the Methods section of the paper should be implemented and a transient simulation should be executed. The MATLAB code requires the voltage and current at the output nodes of the circuits (i.e., Vout and Iout).

Running the code:
 - To plot Fig.1 panels b and c, run the code "S curves/Scurve_plot.m" in MATLAB
 - To plot Fig.1 panels d and e, run the code "Transient simulations/osc_plot.m" in MATLAB
