# System requirements:
 - MATLAB r2023b by Mathworks
The software has been tested on Windows 11 23H2, but the MATLAB code should also work on MacOs 14 Sonoma.
The data here presented has been obtained through the commercial software Advanced Design System 2023 Update 1.


# Installation guide
Here you can find all the MATLAB code and dataset used to plot and reproduce the main figures of the paper.
Each Figure folder contains an "info.txt" file, with instructions on which simulations should be performed and instructions on how to reproduce the data, plus the data used in the paper and the MATLAB code to analyze and plot the results.
No software to install has been developed by us, and implementing the code should be instantaneous.
